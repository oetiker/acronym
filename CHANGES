Version 1.13 (July 2004): if the footnote option was on, footnotes were
printed for ALL acronyms ALL the time, this looked rather odd if the same
acronym was used more than once on the same page. Changed it so that
footnote printing follows the same rules as normal acronym printing (only
print footnote first time). One might think about changing this, so that
either footnotes get printed 'once' per page. Or that the footnote marks are
issued once per acronym and page, so that all instances of the same acronym
on a page get the same footnote mark. Feel free to contribute patches.
